Migration to Python3
--------------------

The code base is old, last used in python2.6.

Changes to be made:

* remove use of "string" module
* convert print statement
* convert imports to python3 syntax, with explicit refence of ceda_cc.
* add the run script for testing in development
* moved source and package mangement files down to Package folder in the repo, leaving top level for repo management and general information about scope and objectives.

These changes were completed in April 2021.
