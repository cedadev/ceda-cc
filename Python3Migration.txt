Migration to Python3
--------------------

The code base is old, last used in python2.6.

* remove use of "string" module
* convert print statement
* convert imports to python3 syntax, with explicit refence of ceda_cc.
* add the run script for testing in development
* moved down to Package folder in the repo, leaving top level for repo management.
