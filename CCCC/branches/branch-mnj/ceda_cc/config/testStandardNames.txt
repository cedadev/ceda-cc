*Consistency of variable NetCDF attributes with MIP tables
*Test of the consistency of the NetCDF attributes of a variable with those specified in a MIP tables entry. The attributes tested will generally include the standard_name, long_name, units, cell_methods, _FillValue and missingvalue. The last 3 have special treatment. The "cell_methods" attribute has a compound structure. The test should parse the structure to evaluate whether the information specified in the MIP tables is given correctly. Inclusion of additional information in the "cell_methods" attribute should be allowed. The two attributes "_FillValue" and "missingvalue" provide the same information. "_FillValue" is given special treatment by the NetCDF libraries, "missingvalue" is included for compatibility with earlier standards. They should be both present or both omitted (for some MIPs it may be specified that they should always be present) and if present, they should have the same value (generally specified in the MIP requirements).
