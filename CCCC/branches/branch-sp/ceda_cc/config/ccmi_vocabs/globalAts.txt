## extracted from DRS v2.2
branch_time = time in parent experiment when this simulation started. 
contact = name and contact information
Conventions = CF-1.6, taken from the MIP table.
creation_date = a string representation of the date when the file was created in the format: 'YYYY-MM-DD-THH:MM:SSZ'.
experiment =  e.g 'Projection Scenario – RCP8.5'.  See Appendix 1 of DRS
experiment_id = the short name of the experiment such as 'refC2' or 'senC2rcp85'.  See Appendix 1 of DRS
forcing = a string containing the list of the 'forcing' agents, following CMIP5.
frequency =  a string indicating the interval between individual time samples.
initialization_method = an integer (≥ 1) referring to the initialization method or observational dataset used to initialize the simulation.
initialization_description = a string containing the details of the particular initialization method used for the experiment. This is only required if groups are submitting runs with more than one initialization method.
institute_id = a short acronym describing the institution (e.g., 'GFDL').
institution = a more free-form attribute to identify the institution that generated the data.
model_id = like the institute_id, a short acronym identifying the model.
modeling_realm = denotes which high-level modeling component is of particular relevence for the dataset. 
parent_experiment_id = indicates which experiment this simulation branched from. ('N/A' if not relevant)
parent_experiment_rip = identifies which member of an ensemble of parent simulations ('N/A' if not relevant)
physics_version = an integer (≥ 1) referring to the physics version used by the model for this run. 
physics_description = a string describing the particular variations in the model that produced the current physics versions.
product = 'output', which indicates that the data you are writing is model output.
project_id = 'CCMI1'
realization = an integer (≥ 1) distinguishing among the members of an ensemble of simulations (e.g. 1, 2, 3,...). 
source = character string fully identifying the model and version used to generate the output.
table_id = should be assigned a character string that identifies the CCMI MIP table where this variable appears. 
tracking_id = a string that is almost certainly unique to this file.
